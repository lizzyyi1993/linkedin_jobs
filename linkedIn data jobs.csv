This position can be performed remotely from anywhere in the world, regardless of any location that might be specified above.]  About Quora  The vast majority of human knowledge is still not on the internet. Most of it is trapped in the form of experience in people's heads, or buried in books and papers that only experts can access. More than a billion people use the internet, yet only a tiny fraction contribute their knowledge to it. We want to democratize access to knowledge of all kinds — from politics to painting, cooking to coding, etymology to experiences — so if someone out there knows something, anyone else can learn it. Our mission is to share and grow the world's knowledge, and we're building a world-class team to help us achieve this mission.    The Data Team is highly empowered at Quora, helping navigate complexity and influencing product and company strategy directly. Quora's outsized commitment to data is visible in everything we do, from our rigor-driven experimentation processes to the backgrounds of our leaders. With this emphasis on data and empirics, we aim to balance rigor and pragmatism, searching for scrappy solutions in pursuit of our mission. In joining Quora's strong data team, you'll both benefit from and work to advance our culture of rational decision making.    As a data scientist, you'll work closely with product managers, product designers, and engineers to devise appropriate measurements and metrics, design randomized controlled experiments, build visualizations, and tackle hard, open-ended problems that uncover usage patterns and opportunities for the company. Quora has a wide range of rich data, giving you ample room for exploration and creativity. Examples of some projects our data scientists have worked on include modeling our long-term growth, improving the relevance and personalization of the homepage feed, and exploratory analysis of factors driving question-asking behavior. For more about our work, see Quora's Data blog at https://data.quora.com/.  As a senior data scientist, you will draw on your experience to excel not only in your own work but also to elevate data’s impact at a company-wide level. You will provide team mentorship that propels the work of your colleagues while helping to establish best practices for data usage across Quora.

We empower campaigns, advocates, and organizers to better engage and mobilize communities to demand improvements to the public education system. We advise and support our partners in their efforts to plan and execute successful, data-driven electoral, organizing, and advocacy campaigns so that together we can transform the politics of education. And, we build political influence, craft strategies, leverage data and develop technology that enable our partners to accelerate progress, particularly those in traditionally marginalized communities.  Who We Are  Our team includes experts and innovators in data, analytics, and strategy. We are former teachers, organizers, data scientists, nonprofit executives, political campaign veterans, and more - and we are looking for people whose passion and expertise can help improve our work and realize our vision.  Background  Murmuration’s role is to support organizations and communities through our political systems, to raise the profile of the issue of public education such that more Americans will prioritize the needs of our students, and to leverage politics to help to create the broader context in which those on the front lines with our children can thrive. We are focused on transforming the politics of education -- partnering with organizations across the country committed to organizing parents and communities around the issues of public education and educational equity, electing to office and holding accountable local leaders who will make improving public K-12 schools a priority, and advocating for policy changes with the goal of improving outcomes for children. To do this, we believe that it is critical that all of the political stakeholders-- electoral organizations, advocacy and organizing groups, charter associations, networks of schools, districts, elected officials, and voters -- to contribute to a strong and politically savvy education sector that works together toward a common vision of improving public education.    The Murmuration Summer Fellowship provides fellows with the unique opportunity to work closely with Murmuration teams on summer projects, while contributing to Murmuration’s mission of transforming the politics of education so that every child can benefit from equal access to equitable and high-quality public schools.

We are a multidisciplinary team of immunologists, genomics technologists, computer scientists, engineers, mathematicians and operators singularly focused on solving an audacious challenge. Backed by some of the leading scientific minds in immunology, oncology, and single cell genomics, we are up for the challenge.  Immunai has begun the process of mapping millions of immune cells and their functions in order to build a proprietary data set for clinical immunological data. The immune system mapping will play an important role in boosting R&D efforts in developing targeted therapies for different diseases. The company noted that the immune system consists of trillions of cells that are divided into different cell types that perform different functions. Because of the complexity of the system, it can be difficult to determine how drugs will interact with the immune cells. This increased understanding can be used to boost clinical response to different cellular therapies.  Immunai's mission is to map the immune system with neural networks and transfer learning techniques informed by deep immunology knowledge. We developed the tools and knowhow to help every immuno-oncology and cell therapy researcher excel at their job. This helps increase the speed in which drugs are developed and brought to market by elucidating their mechanisms of action and resistance.  - New York, NY  - www.immunai.com  - Machine Learning Lead       Desired Personal traits Show more",,Entry level,Full-time,EngineeringInformation Technology,ResearchBiotechnologyPharmaceuticals,127

UW employees offer their boundless energy, creative problem solving skills and dedication to build stronger minds and a healthier world.  UW faculty and staff also enjoy outstanding benefits, professional growth opportunities and unique resources in an environment noted for diversity, intellectual excitement, artistic pursuits and natural beauty.  The International Training and Education Center for Health (I-TECH) and the Department of Global Health recognizes that disparities in health around the globe stem from inequity and encourages and supports the multiple identities of staff, faculty and students including, but not limited to, socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, language, nationality, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, culture, spiritual practice, geography, mental and physical disability and age. As reflected in the I-TECH Diversity Statement, our definition of diversity is broad, recognizing that there are multiple definitions of diversity. We strive to become a local, national, and international leader in developing and maintaining increased representation and recognition of each of these dimensions of diversity among its faculty, staff, and students.  I-TECH is a center in the University of Washington’s Department of Global Health. I-TECH has projects in more than 20 countries, and its worldwide staff work in partnership with local ministries of health, universities, non-governmental organizations, medical facilities, and other partners. I-TECH supports development of skilled work forces and overall health systems strengthening with a focus on sustainability and transition to local ownership. I-TECH is committed to being anti-racist and promotes health and equity in health for all people worldwide.  This position is working for the I-TECH Zimbabwe HIV Care and Treatment program, funded by the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) funding under a cooperative agreement with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The I-TECH Zimbabwe program works with the Zimbabwe Ministry of Health to provide HIV services, site support and quality improvement at 389 health care facilities in 19 districts. The primary objective of this cooperative agreement is to improve district and facility performance in comprehensive prevention, treatment, care, and support of HIV/AIDS and HIV-related conditions in Zimbabwe. An important component of the program is its monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system that collects patient-level and aggregated client data from the facilities on to tablets using the CommCare platform. The data is synced to a central MySQL data base. Program teams then perform data analysis and visualization using Excel and Power BI. Such analysis informs activities at the facility level to improve performance and guides program planning and resource use. Program data is also importantly used for biweekly updates to the funder and quarterly reporting on 22 PEPFAR indicators. The M&E system is run by a Harare based team of data managers and IT specialists.  This work will include the following primary activities: 1) support implementation of I-TECH’s data collection tools, processes, and system updates; 2) conduct routine and non-routine data analysis of aggregated facility and patient level data; 3) oversee data cleaning, quality control, and assembly and organization of datasets for implementation and analysis; 4) write data management code and resolve queries; and 5) design and expand report templates, formats and dashboards.  The Data Scientist will also provide technical assistance for evaluation and epidemiology projects within this portfolio of work, drafting protocols, writing reports and publishing findings. This position will mentor others in research and evaluation methodology and build the capacities of the I-TECH Zimbabwe program to use and apply data toward program improvements.                           This full-time 100% position is based at the I-TECH offices at the UW in Seattle. The Data Scientist requires up to 25% travel to countries that often lack adequate public health and safety infrastructure. Travelers must be prepared to follow the UW and US government recommended precautions and prophylaxis for travel safety and disease prevention. The Data Scientist requires frequent participation in early morning and late evening telephone conference calls in order to accommodate time zone differences between Seattle and its country project sites. I-TECH operates within a grant-funded environment. Due to this, the total amount of this position’s FTE may fluctuate based on program funding and needs.    The application process for UW positions may include completion of a variety of online assessments to obtain additional information that will be used in the evaluation process. These assessments may include Workforce Authorization, Cover Letter and/or others. Any assessments that you need to complete will appear on your screen as soon as you select “Apply to this position”.

Using an open science, multi-scale, team-oriented approach, the AllenInstitute focuses on accelerating foundational research, developing standards and models, and cultivating new ideas to make a broad, transformational impact on science.  The MindScope program seeks to understand the transformations, sometimes called computations, in coding and decoding that lead from photons to behavior and conscious experience by observing, perturbing, and modeling the physical transformations of signals in the cortical-thalamic visual system within a few perception-action cycles.  The defining aspect of the brain is its capacity to produce behavior. The computations which give rise to complex behaviors are highly distributed between multiple regions of the brain. Even though the structural connections are fixed, the interactions between regions are flexible. For different stimuli or for the same stimulus under different conditions, the interactions can be highly variable. We want to understand the mechanisms of dynamical interactions and how does it contribute to the computations which are implemented by the system.  We are seeking a scientist to join the Modeling and Theory team of Stefan Mihalas to work on this project. We will analyze simultaneous recordings in multiple brain regions ( https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03171-x ) to understand the level of flexibility of the inter-areal interactions and under various stimuli and behavioral conditions. We will construct models of computations implemented in solving such tasks, and use structural data ( https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1716-z ) for such constrains. We will analyze which models can reproduce the observed interactions and if the limitations in the interactions act as computational priors or regularizes.  The scientist is expected to have strong contributions at the level of ideas and help shape future projects. Our team focuses on extracting principles from large data, integrating them in simplified models, and using the models to test theories of computation.  The Allen Institute believes that team science significantly benefits from the participation of diverse voices, experiences, and backgrounds. High-quality science can only be produced when it includes different perspectives. We are committed to increasing diversity across every team and encourage people from all backgrounds to apply for this role.                 It is the policy of the Allen Institute to provide equal employment opportunity (EEO) to all persons regardless of age, color, national origin, citizenship status, physical or mental disability, race, religion, creed, gender, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and/or expression, genetic information, marital status, status with regard to public assistance, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state or local law.

Your goal is to improve the ease of discovering content for teachers in their lesson plans, and to recommend content to students to improve their educational outcomes. Your research will translate into solving real-world problems, with an emphasis on live testing. Your work is driven by practical applications, continuously tying development to tangible outcomes based on the product roadmap.    Reporting to the Director of Data Science, you’ll work closely with Data Scientists, Engineers, Product, and Content teams to improve content discovery.

You understand the complexities of building out live machine learning pipelines in production, and have experience choosing metrics to monitor as well as understand tradeoffs between modeling decisions. You prefer deploying practical solutions to test rather than researching theoretical ideas without live data. Ideally, you’ve worked on recommendation systems in the past. You think about the architecture and system of interactions between different algorithms. Bonus if you have experience with knowledge graphs and how it relates to content, experience with NLP, or topic modeling. You love learning more about information retrieval.

In every organization, teams are executing hundreds of repetitive business processes. Team members and business leaders alike want to improve these processes, but often cannot because they don't have visibility into how these processes are actually performed.  Traditionally, the only way to discover and improve business processes has involved big projects, expensive consultants, intrusive over-the-shoulder observations, and countless meetings. The results are one-time snapshots of limited accuracy that take months to produce, and then are quickly out of date.  At Zeitworks, we use automated data collection and Machine Learning to automatically discover, analyze and improve an organization's business processes with zero disruption, and provide business leaders with business insights in near real-time. Our disruptive technology and SaaS delivery model allow us to democratize process improvement by taking it directly to the leaders and team members that perform the work. With Zeitworks, companies can make improvements to upgrade their efficiency and their customer experience.  Zeitworks is led by successful startup executives including Chief Executive Officer Ryan Windham, former CEO of Cedexis (CTXS), and backed by leading venture capital investors Madrona and Jazz Venture Partners.    Zeitworks uses its proprietary Zeitworks Sensor to collect detailed business process activity stream data from its customers. We are looking for a machine learning expert to spearhead the research and development of our ML pipeline to enable our product to make sense and make use of these large, complex data. The Chief Scientist will be responsible for drawing upon multiple fields of expertise to create the core algorithms and models that enable our product to automatically discover and analyze business processes without user disruption.  This is a senior leadership role and a hands-on technical role. In it, you will not only be responsible for driving the technical direction of our ML platform, but also leading and expanding our ML group into a world-class team. The exceptional candidate will have a distinguished research background, including a strong publication record in ML or application areas, but enjoys and has a proven track record of applying these skills to solve complex, real-world problems. We are particularly interested in candidates who have experience with pipelines that include humans-in-the-loop, who thrive in a collaborative environment, and who enjoy mentoring junior scientists and engineers.  One of the most disruptive aspects of our business model is our ability to take our value proposition directly to business leaders under a self-service model, bypassing the traditional enterprise sales cycle, corporate red tape, and system integration projects. This makes Zeitworks a game-changer for companies wanting to make their operations more efficient and effective. You will be instrumental in developing the intellectual property and building the team for Zeitworks to become a disruptive and visionary innovator in the explosive category of process intelligence and automation.             means the relentless pursuit of excellence, both personally and professionally for ourselves and our customers.
